 Hi, My name is Halimah and I work remotely as a freelance Data Analyst. 
											
I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Systems Engineering from the University of Lagos.	
I am Skilled in Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI and Tableau. As a freelance data analyst and data scientist, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and save costs.
I am also experienced in machine learning, supervised and unsupervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I employ technical software such as, Excel, SQL, R, Python for my data projects and Power BI and Tableau for Visualizations.

I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. So thatâ€™s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.
											Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail or linkedin.
