Hi, My name is Halimah and I work as a freelance Data Analyst and Data Scientist. 
 
I specialize in translating complex data into clear, actionable insights. With a Bachelorâ€™s in Systems Engineering from the University of Lagos, I bring expertise in Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau to my projects. Experienced in machine learning, I apply supervised and unsupervised algorithms and use effective visualization tools to uncover patterns and improve decision-making. For collaboration, reach out via email or LinkedIn.
